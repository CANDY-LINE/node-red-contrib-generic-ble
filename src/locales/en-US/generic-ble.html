<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="Generic BLE in">
<p>Emits read characteristic values and/or notified characteristic values.</p>
<h3>Outputs</h3>
<p>
The output object is contained in <code>msg.payload</code> property. Its structure is as follows:
</p>
<pre>
{
  "uuid": "[device UUID placed here]",
  "characteristics":
    "notification": true or false, // true for notified data
    "[readable characteristics UUID 1]": (Buffer object),
    "[readable characteristics UUID 2]": (Buffer object),
                    :
                    :
}
</pre>
<p>
You can access each <code>Buffer object</code> data in the same form as array element accessing like <code>[0]</code>.
</p>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<p>
Expects a message used for triggering <code>Read</code> operations.
This node will read all readable characteristics. These operaions are performed asynchrounsly.
The content of the message paylaod is always <b>IGNORED</b>.
</p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="Generic BLE out">
<p>
Writes characteristic values associated with given characteristic UUIDs.
</p>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<p>
In order to write characteristic values,
the following structure object is required in <code>msg.payload</code> property.
</p>
<pre>
{
  "[writable characteristics UUID 1]": (value),
  "[writable characteristics UUID 2]": (value),
  "writeWithoutResponse": true or false // true for writeWithoutResponse characteristic
}
</pre>
<p>
As <code>writeWithoutResponse</code> property is associated with a whole paylaod,
all characteristics contained in the payload are assumed to have
the same <code>writeWithoutResponse</code> property.
</p>
<p>
The acceptable writable <code>value</code> type is one of:
<ul>
  <li><code>Buffer object</code></li>
  <li><code>int</code> array</li>
  <li>hex string</li>
  <li><code>int</code> value</li>
</ul>
This node translates these values into a Buffer object.
</p>

<p>
By default, you can register your BLE device by providing its MAC address.
If you don't have the address, you can use <code>Scan Result</code> select box in the dialog to find your device.
</p>
<p>
In order to use the widget, enable <code>Select from scan result</code> checkbox.
And you can see the list of BLE devices around the machine where Node-RED runs.
</p>
<p>
This node looks for advertised names and show them on the list.
However, some of devices don't have the name.
In that case, you will see <code>(Unnamed)</code> label.
</p>
<p>
The node will try to update the device name when the device has <code>Device Name (2a00)</code> characteristic.
This can be done when you choose a device from the list.
</p>
<p>
<code>Listening Period</code> means the period of the device connection to receive notify events.
Since the node sequentially accesses each BLE device, the longer period delays the following operations.
</p>
<p>
<code>GATT Characteristics</code> just shows the info provided by the device itself.
The info contains characteristic UUID, which will help you to compose or parse messages
on writing/reading characteristics.
</p>
