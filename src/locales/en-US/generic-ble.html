<p>Emits read characteristic values and/or notified characteristic values. Accepts connect/disconnect requests as well.</p>
<h3>Outputs</h3>
<p>
The output object is contained in <code>msg.payload</code> property. Its structure is as follows:
</p>
<pre>
{
  "uuid": "[device UUID placed here]",
  "characteristics":
    "notification": true or false, // true for notified data
    "[readable characteristics UUID 1]": (Buffer object),
    "[readable characteristics UUID 2]": (Buffer object),
                    :
                    :
}
</pre>
<p>
You can access each <code>Buffer object</code> data in the same form as array element accessing like <code>[0]</code>.
</p>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<p>
Expects a message used for peripheral connecting/disconnecting operation, triggering <code>Read</code> operation, or subscribing <code>Notify</code> events.
<dl>
<dt>For <code>scanStart</code> operation:</dt>
<dd>
In order to start BLE scanning to discover peripheral devices, set <code>msg.topic</code> to <code>scanStart</code>.
<code>msg.payload</code> is always ignored. This operation doesn't emit anything from the Output port.
</dd>
<dt>For <code>scanStop</code> operation:</dt>
<dd>
In order to stop BLE scanning, set <code>msg.topic</code> to <code>scanStop</code>.
<code>msg.payload</code> is always ignored. This operation doesn't emit anything from the Output port.
</dd>
<dt>For <code>scanRestart</code> operation:</dt>
<dd>
In order to restart BLE scanning, set <code>msg.topic</code> to <code>scanRestart</code>.
This operation performs <code>ScanStop</code> then <code>ScanStart</code>.
<code>msg.payload</code> is always ignored. This operation doesn't emit anything from the Output port.
</dd>
<dt>For <code>connect</code> operation:</dt>
<dd>
In order to connect a peripheral device, set <code>msg.topic</code> to <code>connect</code>.
<code>msg.payload</code> is always ignored. This operation doesn't emit anything from the Output port.
</dd>
<dt>For <code>disconnect</code> operation:</dt>
<dd>
In order to disconnect a peripheral device, set <code>msg.topic</code> to <code>disconnect</code>.
<code>msg.payload</code> is always ignored. This operation doesn't emit anything from the Output port.
</dd>
<dt>For <code>Read</code> operation:</dt>
<dd>
You can set one or more characteristic uuids separated by comma (CSV) to query to <code>msg.topic</code>.
However, leave <code>msg.topic</code> empty if you want to query all readable characteristics.
</dd>
<dt>For subscribing <code>Notify</code> events:</dt>
<dd>
In order to subscribe <code>Notify</code> events rather than reading characteristics,
set one or more characteristic uuids separated by comma (CSV) to subscribe to <code>msg.topic</code>
and set the following object to <code>msg.payload</code> as well.
However, leave <code>msg.topic</code> empty if you want to subscribe all notifiable characteristics.
<pre>
{
  "notify": true,
  "period": 6000
}
</pre>
When you set the above in <code>msg.payload</code>, <code>msg.topic</code> is ignored.
The <code>period</code> property is the period for subscribing <code>Notify</code> events in milliseconds <b>per characteristic</b>.
<code>0</code> or less value means to keep subscribing.
</dd>
</dl>

<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="Generic BLE out">
<p>
Writes characteristic values associated with given characteristic UUIDs. Accepts connect/disconnect requests as well.
</p>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<p>
Expects a message used for peripheral connecting/disconnecting operation, or triggering <code>Write</code> operation.
<dl>
<dt>For <code>Connect</code> operation:</dt>
<dd>
In order to connect a peripheral device, set <code>msg.topic</code> to <code>connect</code>.
<code>msg.payload</code> is always ignored.
</dd>
<dt>For <code>Disonnect</code> operation:</dt>
<dd>
In order to disconnect a peripheral device, set <code>msg.topic</code> to <code>disconnect</code>.
<code>msg.payload</code> is always ignored.
</dd>
<dt>For <code>Write</code> operation:</dt>
<dd>
In order to write characteristic values,
the following structure object is required in <code>msg.payload</code> property.
<pre>
{
  "[writable characteristics UUID 1]": (value),
  "[writable characteristics UUID 2]": (value),
  "writeWithoutResponse": true or false // true for writeWithoutResponse characteristic
}
</pre>
<p>
As <code>writeWithoutResponse</code> property is associated with a whole paylaod,
all characteristics contained in the payload are assumed to have
the same <code>writeWithoutResponse</code> property.
</p>
<p>
The acceptable writable <code>value</code> type is one of:
<ul>
  <li><code>Buffer object</code></li>
  <li><code>int</code> array</li>
  <li>hex string</li>
  <li><code>int</code> value</li>
</ul>
This node translates these values into a Buffer object.

<p>
In order to register a new BLE peripheral device, you have to use <code>Scan Result</code> select box in the dialog.
This means whenever you register a new device, you need it and make it discoverable so that this node is able to find it.
</p>
<p>
Check <code>BLE Scanniing</code> in order to start BLE scanning. And you can see the list of BLE devices around the machine where Node-RED runs.
The select box lsit values will be updated automatically when BLE scanning is running. They will be refreshed every 10 seconds.
</p>
<p>
This node looks for advertised names and show them on the list.
However, some of devices don't have the name (or failed to resolve it because of the underlying BLE library limitations).
In that case, you will see a device address or a <code>(Unnamed)</code> label text.
</p>
<p>
Once you choose a device to register, click/tap <code>Apply</code> button to apply the selected device.
<code>Local Name</code>, <code>MAC</code> and <code>UUID</code> will be populated automatically.
<code>GATT Characteristics</code> will also be updated when services and characteristics discovery is successful.
When you see <code>(not available)</code> message in the box, check if the device is NOT sleeping (a sleeping device fails to respond to a connect request) and click <code>Apply</code> again.
</p>
